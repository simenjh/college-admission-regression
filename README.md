# Predicting college admission chances using linear regression

college_admission() in college_admission.py learns the parameters for the linear hypothesis through gradient descent.

* Gradient descent is implemented from scratch.
* The data is preprocessed using sklearn.


Passing plot_cost=True to college_admission() plots the training cost as a function of iterations.
