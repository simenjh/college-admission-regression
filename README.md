## Predicting college admission chances using linear regression

college_admission() in college_admission.py learns the parameters for the linear hypothesis through gradient descent.

* Gradient descent is implemented from scratch.
* The data is preprocessed using sklearn.


Passing plot_X=True to college_admission() will reduce the feature space from 7 to 1 using PCA, and plot the data along with the dependent variable y.

Passing plot_cost=True to college_admission() plots the training cost as a function of iterations.
